Porting status
==============
- Linux: This is the primary development platform, and should always work
- FreeBSD: Status unknown
- Windows: Status unknown
- Mac OS X: Status unknown


Installation requirements
=========================

- OpenOffice.org (Office and SDK), version 2.0.4 or later.
- Libvoikko version 1.0 or later, and compatible versions of Suomi-malaga and
  malaga.
- On Linux: the C++ compiler from the GCC, version 3.4 or later. Other tools
  needed for compilation are usually present in default setups of any
  distribution.


Instructions for compilation
============================

- Install all of the required software listed above.
- Makefile contains some parameters that you may want to modify at this point.
- In a shell, run the SDK setup script which is located in the SDK installation
  directory. It is called setsdkenv_unix on Linux and setsdkenv_windows on
  Windows. During the first run, this script will ask the location of certain
  tools. You should answer the questions, although at least on Linux the
  defaults are usually correct. Answers to these questions will be saved under
  the home directory of the user (for example to a file
  openoffice.org2.0_sdk/setsdkenv_unix.sh).
- Run "make". This will build the extensions package voikko.oxt under
  subdirectory build.


Bug reports and patches

Change history
==============

Version 2.0 is an almost total rewrite of the previous version 1.2. This
version is designed to work well with libvoikko and aims to use the best
current practices for OpenOffice.org extension development. The old code
was based on the internals of OpenOffice.org 1.0 and designed to work with
a non-free Finnish spellchecking library.

The license has been changed from LGPL to GPL to reflect the fact that this
extension is useless without libvoikko, which is distributed under the GPL.
